    <h3>Reggae Artist</h3>
   <p>“Sensational! Listen the DJ song, get it right and don’t get it wrong”. That’s the familiar call from rising Dancehall Artist Glamaton. Kirk Andrew Mitchell grew up in St. Elizabeth and began performing when he was ten years old. Inspired by Beres Hammond, his idols Beenie Man, Bounty Killer and Bob Marley, Kirk was always around music. 
    <br><br>
    
    At St. Elizabeth Junior High his “cute face” had the girls calling him “Glamour Boy”. If he was not on stage at school concerts, the show was considered a “flop”— sick or absent, without him, the concert would be postponed. Talk about star appeal!! Soon he was known as the vibes man, dancer and entertainer. As his popularity grew, the boys at school gave him the new stage name “Glamaton”.

        In the years following high school, Glamaton pursued other interests while still developing his style and technique as an entertainer. After visiting Grand Cayman for a number of years in the early 1990’s, he settled there in 1996. His first single came with “Love Again” in 2006, then “Wrong Inna JA”. Follow up singles “Jamaica Island Is Fun” in 2008 and “Fi De Gyal Dem” in 2009 brought increasing airplay and exposure for Glamaton in Cayman and Jamaica.
        <br><br>
        
        Glamaton continued building his popularity in Cayman and Jamaica, opening for artists such as Morgan Heritage, Beenie Man and Bounty Killer, also gracing the stage at some of Jamaica’s biggest shows like Sting, GT Extravaganza and Reggae Fever. With his own K&M Productions, Glamaton writes and produces many of his own lyrics and rhythms like the “Touchdown Rhythm” and “Overheat Rhythm”.

        His 2011 release “Woman Plan” on DC’s “Midnight Rhythm” took to the airwaves by storm. Since then, he has been persistent and consistent across radio, television and social media with “Dem A Fight We”, “On Mi Mind”, “Rolling Deep”, “No Waste No Time”, “No Bad Mind” and “Properly”. Charting a course for the greatest reggae show on earth, Reggae Sumfest as well as the international stage, his latest songs “Good Memories” and “Better Days” are striking a chord with many listeners in 2018. Nostalgia is always a winner and so are these new tunes from Glamaton. As a husband and a father, Glamaton says “I want my songs to be fun, appealing to young and old, with clean, conscious, uplifting lyrics and messages, especially for the youth”. When he’s not entertaining on stage, Glamaton is on the football field or throwing it down on the dominoe tables. In Cayman he’s a valuable member of the Island All Stars Domino Club
