        <h1>WOMAN PLAN</h1>
        <p><b>"Woman Plan"</b> by Glamaton is an empowering anthem that celebrates the ambition and independence of women. With a catchy melody and lyrics that inspire women to dream big and pursue financial success, this song serves as a motivational soundtrack for anyone striving to achieve their goals. 
        <br><br>
        
        Released in <b>2023</b>, Glamaton states <i>“too many women nowadays go with the flow of life. they want to just ease off in life and let the wind steer the boat. that's why woman plan now, preaching to the ladies that they should have an idea of what to do, where to go, and how to make sumn substantial with their lives, they should be looking forward to making their next million. so all I want is for them to listen to this song, and get motivated to either start working on something or continue building what they have in the works”</i>

        <h3>Glamaton attacks destructive social media in ‘Negativity’</h3>
        <p1>December 4,2021</p1>
        <img src="glamaton-1024x634.jpg">
          <p>In his latest single, Negativity, Cayman-based dancehall artiste Glamaton urges people to be more mindful of the content they share on social media. The outspoken deejay said the constant sharing of negative content online is having a deleterious impact on the minds of people across the globe.
            <br><br>
            <i style="font-weight: 600;">“A lot of people go on social media every day just to spread false news and gossip,” he said while speaking about the inspiration behind the song.
            <br><br>
            “There are also many cyber bullies online trolling and body-shaming people. Scientific research has proven that the rise of social media has caused the rate of depression and suicides to increase worldwide. This is very sad. People need to use social media more wisely.” </i>
